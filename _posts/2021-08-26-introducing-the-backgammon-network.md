Welcome to the [Backgammon Network](https://www.bkgmn.net), a free, open source, multiplayer backgammon service.

I'm [Sam](https://www.sambeirne.com). The Backgammon Network started as a way for me to familiarize myself with modern web technologies, like WebSockets and web components. My background is in game development, and a multiplayer browser-based game seemed like the perfect way to hone my skills.

Rather than create something new, I chose backgammon, a timeless classic, as the focal point of this project. While far from being an expert player, I appreciate backgammon's unique combination of luck and skill. There are other ways to play online, but I hope that the Backgammon Network will be of value to other players who enjoy the game.

This site is open source. You can follow its development on [GitHub](https://github.com/softwerks).
